### How It Works

    * The application uses React for its user interface.
    * It fetches movie data from the TMDB API for both popular movies and search results.
    * Users can search for movies by entering keywords in the search bar and pressing Enter or clicking the "Search" button.
    * Popular movies are displayed by default when the app is loaded.
    * Movie details are shown when a user clicks on a movie card.
